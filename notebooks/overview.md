# TRACER Plotting

This is a place to collaborate on plots related to Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER), which is a field campaign taking place near Houston, Texas.

Here are some steps to getting started with using these notebooks + analysis codes!

## Install the Environment

Before getting started with the materials in this repository, you will need to install the environment using the following steps:

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ARM-Synergy/tracer-plotting.git
```

1. Move into the new directory and install + activate the enviroment (using conda or mamba)

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tracer-plotting-dev
```

## Use the Notebooks

You can interact with the notebooks by using the [JupyterBook](https://arm-synergy.github.io/tracer-plotting/overview.html), which renders the notebooks and has an option to launch the notebooks on Binder.

You can also launch these notebooks using your local environment by moving into the `notebooks` directory after starting your Jupyter session.
